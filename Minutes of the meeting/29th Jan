Relational Inductive bias - structure of the model
Non-relational inductive bias - normalization, dropout

inductive bias lets a model choose better solutions

Hierarchy of different objects in our brain - referred from cog sci papers
our brain shifts these hierarchies in presence of data

MLP - no position invariance in input layer - example find the CoM of N body system

GraphNets
G = (nodes, edges, global attrs)
Edge update function:
  Receiver, sender matrix
